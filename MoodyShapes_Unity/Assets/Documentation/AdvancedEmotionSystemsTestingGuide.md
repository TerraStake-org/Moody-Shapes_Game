[SerializeField] private int _maxMemoryUsageMB = 500;
```

## Enhanced Component Features

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Component References**:
   - Ensure all required components are present
   - Check component initialization order

2. **Performance Issues**:
   - Reduce number of test shapes
   - Check for memory leaks

   - Verify rigidbody settings
   - Ensure accessory prefabs exist

### Test Report Interpretation

The integration test generates detailed reports including:
- Overall pass/fail rates
- Performance metrics (FPS, memory usage)
- Failed test details
- Execution time analysis
- System compatibility status

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios

Create custom tests by extending the integration test system:

```csharp
IEnumerator MyCustomTest()
{
    var result = new IntegrationTestResult("My Custom Test");
    float startTime = Time.time;
    
    try
    {
        // Your test logic here
        result.passed = true; // or false
        result.details = "Test description";
    }
    catch (System.Exception e)
    {
        result.passed = false;
        result.details = $"Exception: {e.Message}";
    }
    
    result.executionTime = Time.time - startTime;
    RecordTestResult(result);
    
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.1f);
}
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration

The testing framework provides real-time performance monitoring:
- Frame rate tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- System resource utilization
- Component-specific performance metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Run integration tests after major changes
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for performance regressions
3. **Memory Management**: Monitor for memory leaks during development
4. **Component Isolation**: Test individual systems before integration
5. **Scene Cleanup**: Clear test objects between test runs
6. **Documentation**: Document any test failures and resolutions

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the testing framework:
- Automated CI/CD integration
- Performance regression detection
- Visual test result dashboards
- Network multiplayer testing
- VR/AR compatibility testing
- Platform-specific test suites

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing framework ensures the reliability, performance, and integration quality of the advanced emotion systems in Moody Shapes. Regular use of these tools will help maintain system stability and catch integration issues early in development.
